;;;; Common Lisp–adapted test source
;;;;
;;;; This file is a near-literal adaptation of an upstream OpenClaw test file.
;;;; It is intentionally not yet idiomatic Lisp. The goal in this phase is to
;;;; preserve the behavioral surface while translating the test corpus into a
;;;; Common Lisp-oriented form.
;;;;
;;;; Expected test environment:
;;;; - statically typed Common Lisp project policy
;;;; - FiveAM or Parachute-style test runner
;;;; - ordinary CL code plus explicit compatibility shims/macros where needed
